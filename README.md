## Manticore Demo Programs


</div>

### Description

These are 5 demo programs (real short) that demonstrate some of the capabilities of my Manticore library/engine. All of these demos are based on the "Bouncing Ball" routine. This is great for anyone who is interested in looking for any Bouncing Ball stuff, or just wondering about Manticore in general.

To give you some background on this, Manticore started out as a pet project of mine about 2 years ago. I slowly began building a common library of modules, which were then converted to classes and finally brought together into an ActiveX DLL. The resulting code is Manticore, a 2-D tiling engine / game library. I don't mean to replace DirectX at all, rather I plan on wrapping DX 7 interfaces around Manticore after improving it some. I also have another larger demo in the works (a game), to show some of the other features Manticore has. If anyone would like documentation on it, please e-mail me.
 
### More Info
 
Make sure you have Manticore.dll registered properly (included in the ZIP) using REGSVR32.EXE

Will not run on Windows NT.
